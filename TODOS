Tuesday
  Get approvals/deliveries to work.
    commit
  Re-work the requests page to use the globals/initialize method.
  Fix typeahead.
  Cross-reference search results to better display them.

    Lending view
      Be able to view lent books, receive them back, pending requests, change duration, approve them.
      be able to view your request history.

  Clean up unused routes/controllers
  Use custom routes instead of just the general update route to change status on rental requests.
