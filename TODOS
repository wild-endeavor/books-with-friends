Typeahead doesn't work after doing one search

After hitting the add bookshelf button, set the focus to the search box

When moving from Library view to search view, maintain the state of the shelf index


Tuesday
  Cross-reference search results to better display them.
  Fix typeahead


Wednesday/Thursday
  Make the friends view better looking.
  Looks and small items.
  Make an alert section that works.


Additional things to implement:
  Use subviews for the rental request page instead of re-rendering the whole page.
  Change model structure so that books belong directly to a user instead of through a bookshelf.
  Allow users to cancel requests
  Allow users to reject requests
  Allow users to change the due-date on approval, and extend/change the due date of books lent out.
  Add waiting lists
  Move books user has borrowed onto a separate, special shelf.
  Clean up unused routes/controllers
  Use custom routes instead of just the general update route to change status on rental requests.
  Add the whole searching for friends thing.  Currently the site should be called
    books-with-friends-that-you-add-on-the-backend
