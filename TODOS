Typeahead doesn't work after doing one search

After hitting the add bookshelf button, set the focus to the search box

When moving from Library view to search view, maintain the state of the shelf index


Tuesday
  Re-work the requests page to use the globals/initialize method.
  After making a request, remove it from the view - via adding it to the collection.
  Cross-reference search results to better display them.
  Fix typeaheadx



Wednesday/Thursday
  Make the friends view better looking.
  Looks and small items.
  Make an alert section that works.


Additional things to implement:
  Use subviews for the rental request page instead of re-rendering the whole page.
  Allow users to cancel requests
  Allow users to reject requests
  Allow users to change the due-date on approval, and extend/change the due date of books lent out.
  Clean up unused routes/controllers
  Use custom routes instead of just the general update route to change status on rental requests.
