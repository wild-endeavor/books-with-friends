Two users make a request, a day apart.
Both should be valid, because the book is in-stock.
The owner sees both, approves one, which should reject all the others.

Upon approval, the view should change to allow the owner to mark it as delivered.

Upon approval, the status of the book should be marked as unavailable to borrow.

If another request comes in when it is out, then reject.

A book is marked as available again when the owner marks it as returned.



Need to know at all times:

Your friend's books.
Your non-finished rental requests.
